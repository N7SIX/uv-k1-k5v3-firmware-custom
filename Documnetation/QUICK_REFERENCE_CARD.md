## S-METER INTERPRETATION

```
S0    No signal
S1    Barely detectable
S2-S3 Weak signal
S4-S5 Moderate signal (typical contact)
S6-S7 Good signal strength
S8-S9 Strong signal, excellent contact
+10+20 Overload (signal too strong)
```

---

## SPECTRUM DISPLAY LEGEND

```
┌─ Spectrum Trace (blue solid line)
│  = Real-time RF amplitude per frequency
│
├─ Peak Hold (dashed line above)
│  = Maximum signal history, gradually fades
│
├─ Noise Floor (baseline, bottom area)
│  = Ambient RF background (-120 to -100 dBm typical)
│
└─ Waterfall (16 rows, grayscale)
   = Signal history over time (top=newest)
   = Dark=weak, Light=strong
```

## EMERGENCY PROCEDURES

### Radio Won't Power On
1. Check battery connection
2. Verify battery voltage (should be 7.4V DC)
3. Try different battery if available
4. Hold [PWR] for 3 seconds (cold start)

### Cannot Transmit
1. Check [PTT] button is fully pressed
2. Verify TX power is not set to <20mW (change via [F]+[2])
3. Check frequency lock is disabled (Menu → FLck)
4. Ensure modulation is valid for band

### Recovered from Crash (Frozen Display)
1. Press [PWR] to power off
2. Wait 5 seconds
3. Press [PWR] again to restart
4. Use [MENU] → Factory reset if problem persists

## TONE/CTCSS PROGRAMMING QUICK START

1. **Find tone/code needed**: Ask local repeater coordinator
2. **Go to target frequency/channel**
3. **Press [MENU]**
4. **Navigate to 08 CTCSS or 09 DCS**
5. **Use [UP]/[DOWN] to select** (e.g., 123.0 Hz for CTCSS)
6. **Press [EXIT]** to save

**Common CTCSS Tones**:
- **67.0 Hz** - Standard amateur (most common)
- **110.9 Hz** - Heavy usage US repeaters
- **162.2 Hz** - GMRS standard

## EMERGENCY FREQUENCY CHART

| Region | Frequency | Mode | Notes |
|--------|-----------|------|-------|
| **N. America** | 146.52 MHz | FM | Simplex calling frequency |
| **Europe** | 145.50 MHz | FM | International simplex |
| **UK** | 145.50 MHz | FM | License-required |
| **Australia** | 146.50 MHz | FM | Primary simplex |

**IMPORTANT**: Verify your license covers these frequencies before transmitting.

## BATTERY TROUBLESHOOTING

| Symptom | Likely Cause | Fix |
|---------|--------------|-----|
| Battery fully charged but displays 0% | Calibration error | Menu → 13 BatSave → [F] |
| Radio powers off suddenly | Voltage droops below 2.8V | Charge/replace battery |
| Slow spectrum updates with battery low | CPU throttling | Normal; wait for charge |
| Battery icon flashing | Critical voltage <2.5V | Stop all TX immediately |

## TECHNICAL NOTES FOR ADVANCED USERS

### Spectrum Analyzer Behavior

- **Waterfall updates every frame** (60Hz display refresh)
- **Spectrum trace based on** 128 frequency bins (configurable step)
- **Peak hold automatically resets** when new scan starts
- **Noise floor fluctuates** ±3-5 dB depending on RF environment
- **Multipath fading** may show multiple peaks at same frequency (normal in urban areas)

### CPU/Battery Optimization

- **High-capacity waterfall** uses ~5% additional CPU
- **Peak hold rendering** is computationally light
- **Spectrum updates throttled** to 6-tick heavy cycle (conserves CPU)
- **Expect: normal 2-3% CPU load for bandscope**

### Known Behaviors (NOT Bugs)

1. **Spectrum grass slows after 2-3 seconds**: EMA filter converges (mathematical norm)
   - **Workaround**: Restart scan to reset
2. **Waterfall shows only 3 lines during RX**: Known firmware limitation
   - **Workaround**: Use listening offset frequency
3. **Peak hold fades gradually**: Exponential decay (designed behavior)
   - **Normal**: Gradual fade over ~30 seconds
