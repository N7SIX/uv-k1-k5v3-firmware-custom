## 🎯 QUICK START (5 MINUTES)

1. **Power on**: Press [PWR]
2. **Tune frequency**: Use [UP]/[DOWN] arrow keys
3. **Select modulation**: Press [0] to cycle (FM/AM/USB/LSB/CW)
4. **Adjust squelch**: [F] + [UP]/[DOWN] to find signal
5. **Transmit**: Press [PTT]

See [QUICK_REFERENCE_CARD.md](QUICK_REFERENCE_CARD.md#essential-controls-at-a-glance) for all key shortcuts.

## 📊 SPECTRUM ANALYZER QUICK START

1. **Activate**: Press [F] + [5]
2. **Start scanning**: Press [* SCAN]
3. **Watch the display**:
   - Blue trace = real-time signal
   - Waterfall rows = signal history (top=newest)
   - Dashed line = peak hold (maximum memory)
4. **Lock on signal**: Radio auto-tunes when detecting (Listen mode)
5. **Resume scanning**: Press [EXIT] when done

See [Owner_Manual_ApeX_Edition.md#professional-spectrum-analyzer](Owner_Manual_ApeX_Edition.md#professional-spectrum-analyzer) for detailed explanation of all display elements.

## ❓ FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS

### Q: What's the difference between these three documents?

**Owner's Manual** = User guide (how to operate the radio)
**Quick Reference** = Cheat sheet (fast lookups)  
**Technical Appendix** = Engineer's guide (how it works internally)

### Q: I'm lost, where do I start?

→ Start with [Owner_Manual_ApeX_Edition.md](Owner_Manual_ApeX_Edition.md#getting-started) "Getting Started" section.

### Q: My spectrum analyzer shows flat lines after 2-3 seconds, is it broken?

→ **No, this is normal.** See [TECHNICAL_APPENDIX.md#problem-spectrum-grass-slowssdies-after-2-3-seconds](TECHNICAL_APPENDIX.md#problem-spectrum-grass-slowssdies-after-2-3-seconds) for detailed explanation.

### Q: How do I tune to a specific frequency?

→ Use [UP]/[DOWN] arrow keys, or enter digits directly ([0-9] keys). See [QUICK_REFERENCE_CARD.md#frequency-quick-entry](QUICK_REFERENCE_CARD.md#frequency-quick-entry).

### Q: What's the S-meter showing me?

→ Signal strength in standard IARU scale (S0-S9+20). See [QUICK_REFERENCE_CARD.md#s-meter-interpretation](QUICK_REFERENCE_CARD.md#s-meter-interpretation).

### Q: How do I activate the spectrum analyzer?

→ Press [F] + [5]. See [Owner_Manual_ApeX_Edition.md#accessing-the-spectrum-analyzer](Owner_Manual_ApeX_Edition.md#accessing-the-spectrum-analyzer).

### Q: Can I increase the spectrum update rate?

→ Yes, but it costs battery. See [TECHNICAL_APPENDIX.md#optimization-strategies](TECHNICAL_APPENDIX.md#optimization-strategies).

### Q: Why doesn't my peak hold match the current trace?

→ Peak hold shows maximum history and fades exponentially. See [TECHNICAL_APPENDIX.md#peak-hold-algorithm](TECHNICAL_APPENDIX.md#peak-hold-algorithm).
